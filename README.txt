CustomExtensions - Custom Extension Methods For C#

This is an open-source library of C# extension methods used to add
functionality to commonly used classes and to enhance LINQ.

Inspiration for some methods comes from John Skeet's Morelinq library:

XML docmumentation is in place, but need to work on a wiki or other project
documentation.
